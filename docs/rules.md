Rules for playing tictactoe
---

* The game is played by two **different** players.
* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. 
* Players take turns putting their marks(X or O) in empty squares.
* After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his mark, which will be different from the mark of the first player.
* The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three, or focus on creating his own row of three.   
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. 
* If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. 
* After the game is over, either player can request another round on a cleaned map.
* In the meantime, the score is counted.
